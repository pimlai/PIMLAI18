<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The one-day workshop focuses on the technical aspects of privacy research with invited and contributed talks by distinguished researchers in the area. We will conclude the workshop with a panel discussion about ethical and regulatory aspects. The programme of the workshop will emphasize the diversity of points of view on the problem of privacy, exemplified by the approaches pursued by specific sub-communities scattered across the different meetings comprising the Federated Artificial Intelligence Meeting. We will also ensure there is ample time for discussions that encourage networking between researches from these different sub-communities, which should result in mutually beneficial new long-term collaborations.</p>

<p>We invite submissions of recent work on privacy in machine learning and artificial intelligence, both theory and application-oriented. Similarly to how ICML, IJCAI, AAMAS, and other FAIM workshops are organized, all accepted abstracts will be part of a poster session held during the workshop. Additionally, the PC will select a subset of the abstracts for short oral presentations. At least one author of each accepted abstract is expected to represent it at the workshop.</p>
<p>Submissions in the form of extended abstracts must be <strong>at most 4 pages long</strong> (not including references) and <strong>adhere to the <a href="https://media.nips.cc/Conferences/ICML2018/Styles/icml2018_style.tar.gz"> ICML format</a></strong>. We do accept submissions of work recently published or currently under review. Submissions do not need to be anonymized. The workshop will not have formal proceedings, but authors of accepted abstracts can choose to have their work published on the workshop webpage.</p>
